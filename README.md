YouTube Data Analysis using the YouTube API

This project extracts and analyzes data from multiple YouTube channels using the YouTube Data API. In this project I retrieve channel statistics, video details, top comments, and practice exploratory data analysis with visualizations to understand engagement metrics, video performance, and publishing patterns. The dataset is fetched from selected YouTube channels and includes information such as subscribers, total views, total videos, video-specific details like views, likes, comments, duration, tags, and publish dates, as well as top comments for each video.

The analysis includes identifying the best and worst performing videos by view count, comparing view distributions across channels using violin plots, exploring engagement through views versus likes and comments, analyzing video duration distributions, generating word clouds from video titles, and examining publishing schedules by weekday.

Through this project, I gained experience working with the YouTube Data API to retrieve large-scale channel and video data, preprocessing and cleaning API data for analysis, and visualizing insights using matplotlib, seaborn, and WordCloud. I also developed a better understanding of channel and video performance metrics and how to compare multiple channels effectively.
